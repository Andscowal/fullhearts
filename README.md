# fullhearts

This site is live at fullhearts.site

The first project I had ever worked on, built from scratch with HTML5 and CSS3.
There is no back end code so the "Submit" section does not actually submit anywhere, but everything is handwritten!
 
I intend to return to this project to add updated functionality and make this site fully operational whenever free time permits!
But if anyone would like to give it a shot, I'd love to see your work!

Thanks for stopping by and happy coding!
